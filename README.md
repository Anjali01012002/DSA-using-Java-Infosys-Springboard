This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures and algorithms based on the Infosys Springboard course.

## Course Content

- **Introduction to Data Structures**
- **Array**
- **Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Collections Framework and Generics**
- **Introduction to Algorithms**
- **Analysis of Algorithms**
- **Searching Algorithms**
- **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Algorithm Techniques**
- **Comparison of Algorithms**

## Files Added

 ### 1 : `src/ArrayOperations.java`

This file demonstrates basic array operations with user input, including:

- **Initialization**: Displays an initial array.
- **Insertion**: Inserts an element at a specified position.
- **Deletion**: Removes an element from a specified position.
- **Traversal**: Displays all elements with their indices.

The program takes user input for insertion and deletion operations and prints the state of the array after each operation.

### 2 : `src/SinglyLinkedList.java`

This file demonstrates various operations on a singly linked list, including:

- **Insertion at Beginning**: Adds a new node at the start of the linked list.
- **Insertion at End**: Adds a new node at the end of the linked list.
- **Insertion After a Given Node**: Adds a new node after a specific node.
- **Deletion of Node by Key**: Deletes the first occurrence of a specified key in the linked list.
- **Search for a Node**: Searches for a node with a specified key.
- **Print List**: Displays the linked list from the first to the last node.

The program includes a menu-driven interface that allows the user to perform different operations on the singly linked list based on user input.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the repository**:

   git clone https://github.com/Anjali01012002/dsa-java-infosys-springboard.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: 

    cd dsa-java-infosys-springboard

3. **Compile and run Java files**:

    **Compile**: To compile a Java file, use:

        javac src/filename.java

    **Run**: To run the compiled Java file, use: 

        java -cp src filename  

    **Note**: The -cp src option specifies the classpath for the Java runtime, which is necessary if your .java files are organized in a directory like src/.

4. **File Types**:

    **Java Source Files (.java)**: These files contain the implementations of various data structures and algorithms. These are the files you should focus on and commit.
    **Compiled Class Files (.class)**: These are generated when you compile Java files. They are not included in the repository and should not be pushed to GitHub.

5. **Repository Structure**:

    **src/**: Directory containing Java source files.
    **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and usage instructions.
    **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
